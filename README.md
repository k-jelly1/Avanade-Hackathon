# Avanade-Hackathon

**Safe Apply** is a web app that allows job seekers to apply for jobs anonymously while emphasizing more in their talent. To achieve this, we encrypt all identifying information to help recruiters make fair and unbiased hiring decisions in the initial screening process. This not only helps eliminate unconscious bias but also encourages employers to focus more on a candidate's skills and experience.

In addition, our app also includes learning resources section to increase unconscious bias awareness among recruiters, promoting a more inclusive and diverse hiring process. This helps to address the root cause of bias and discrimination by educating employers on the importance of diversity and inclusion in the workplace.
